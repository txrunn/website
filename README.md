# My Personal Website

This is a Phoenix web application that showcases my projects and skills as an aspiring cloud security engineer.

## Features

- A clean, modern but efficient-to-code design to showcase my portfolio projects and skills.
- An intuitive interface that makes it easy to navigate through my website and find the information you need.
- No database required, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Technology

This website is built using the Phoenix web framework, which is built on the Elixir programming language. Elixir and Phoenix provide several benefits over typical JavaScript stacks, including:

- **Concurrency**: Elixir is designed to handle thousands of concurrent connections with ease, making it a great choice for building highly scalable web applications.
- **Fault tolerance**: Elixir's fault-tolerant design ensures that my website is always up and running, even during unexpected errors or failures.
- **Performance**: Phoenix is known for its exceptional performance, providing fast and reliable web requests that are essential for high-traffic websites.
- **Containerization**: By using Docker containers, my website is easily deployable to any server or cloud platform. Containerization also ensures that my website is consistent and reliable across different environments.

## Future Plans

I plan to add a feature to sort through my projects based on specific skills. This will hopefully make it even easier for recruiters and potential employers to find the projects that match what skills they're looking for. I'm also planning on adding PWA functionality, but it's not a huge priority.

Thank you for taking the time to read through all this! If you have any questions or would like to learn more about me or my work, please feel free to contact me via my LinkedIn profile or the email provided in my resume.


# Website

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Or you can just go to [`tarungunaseelan.com`](https://www.tarungunaseelan.com) to see it in action lol.
